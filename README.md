WORD GUESS GAME
A simple console-based Word Guessing Game developed using Python. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word one character at a time within a limited number of attempts.

Features:
- Random word selection using Python’s random module
- Interactive user input and real-time feedback
- Limited number of guesses to increase difficulty
- Displays correctly guessed letters and hides remaining ones
- Win/Loss condition handling

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Built-in libraries (random)

How It Works:
- The user enters their name.
- A random word is selected by the program.
- The player guesses characters one by one.
- Correct guesses reveal letters; incorrect guesses reduce remaining turns.
- The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or attempts run out.

Purpose:

This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, string handling, and user input/output.
